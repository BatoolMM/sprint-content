## Introduction

It is quite often to see news articles discussing how data and efforts like [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.us/) have been critical in supporting the disaster emergency responses all over the world. This is only an example among many others demonstrating the value of data, particularly open and public data, in our daily life and for public good.

But what is data? What is open data? What are the key characteristics of open data? This is something you will learn during this lesson. Upon completion of this first lesson of the open data module, you should

-   Understand the definition and key characteristics of open data
-   Understand the concept of metadata, primary, and secondary data
    




## 1.1 What is Data?

Data is any type of information, recordable or observable facts needed to answer the research questions of a project. It can be numbers, texts, measurements, images, and more. Research data is collected for different purposes and in different formats and can be grouped in different ways, for example:

- Qualitative data which describes information in words versus quantitative data which defines the numerical information such as measurements
- Grouped vs ungrouped data
- Structured vs unstructured data 

In this lesson, we want to introduce the idea of primary and secondary data which are domain agnostic and are directly related to the benefits and challenges of open data (see Lesson 2). Additionally, we will also introduce the concept of metadata, which is critical in supporting the development of open data and open science initiatives. 

a. **Primary data**

Primary data often refers to data that are directly collected or created by the researcher. Examples include surveys, questionnaires, interviews, physical samples, specimens, output from models, remote sensing data (spectral/photons), etc. Research questions guide the collection of the data. A researcher will formulate a question, develop a methodology and go ahead to collect the data. Some examples of primary data include: 

- Interviews, questionnaires, and surveys responses. In behavioral and social sciences, these data collection methods are often used to collect self-reported data. A researcher designs these questions to collect data from participants that are necessary for the research. These are usually mostly shareable if they are de-identified, and if the participants consent about the data being shared. Interviews can address a broad range of quantitative or qualitative oriented research questions, and may be used on their own or as part of a mixed methods approach (Banner, 2010). Interviews generate data, usually in the form of recorded audio ﬁles, transcripts, and notes and other observational data. 
- Physical samples, specimens, and resources form the base of many studies. Tests and analyses are conducted on these resources, such as biological specimens, rocks and minerals, soils and sediments, plants and seeds, water samples, archaeological artefacts, or DNA and human tissue samples ([Research Data Alliance Interest Group on Physical Samples](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig)). It may be more difficult to share these types of resources, but it is possible. See the work of BioBanks, [IGSN](https://www.igsn.org/) (a persistent identifier specifically for physical samples, see lesson 3), and [iSamples](https://isamplesorg.github.io/home/). To learn more about how to manage physical samples and collections, read the 23 Things Physical Samples document (https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00067).

b. **Secondary data**

Secondary data often refers to data that is created or collected by someone else and made available for use by other researchers. Examples include literature, publications, generated statistics such as government statistics, transcripts of recordings, and analyzed/processed data from primary data. The data is originally collected for a purpose other than the current one, for example, from a previous experiment or from another research project. 
    
The sharing of secondary data through articles and publicatons, or repositories allows researchers especially those who cannot afford to collect or create their own data, to develop research projects based on existing data. Using secondary data is also important in cases where sources of the primary data are rare and it would be beneficial to share for use as secondary data by other researchers. Population-based studies are a discipline that benefit a lot from secondary data availability, for example. “A case study in library and information service research showed that when good secondary data is available, researchers can gain access to and utilize high quality larger datasets, such as those collected by funded studies or agencies that involve larger samples and contain substantial breadth. The larger samples are more representative of the target population and allow for greater validity and more generalizable findings (Smith, 2008; Smith et al., 2011). Access to this type of data presents opportunities for all researchers, even the novice or unfunded researcher, therefore equalizing opportunities and building capacity for empirical research (Hakim, 1982) in LIS research”  (https://doi.org/10.1006/lmot.2001.1098).

> **NOTE**: The same dataset could be primary data in one scenario and secondary data in another. This depends on the user, and thus the collector of dataset. 
> 
> For example, the interview data collected in one research project is considered primary data but it can be shared after the interview has been de-identified and received proper participant consent for sharing. If these interview data are shared, the data become secondary data for the new research. There are great benefits of sharing data following approprate proceedures. This will be covered in later lessons (Lesson 3–5).

_**Self Assesment:** Do you know the difference between promary and secondary data?_

A researcher needs data on trauma for an ongoing project. 

_Senario 1_: They visit a trauma center and asks questions to patients in the trauma center. What type of data was collected? 

_Senario 2_: In the trauma center, they are referred to a database where they can find responses from patients. What type of data was collected?

c. **Metadata** 

Metadata is a type of data that describes the data. It is often used to provide information about a dataset to enable easy use and interpretation of the data. Metadata can facilitate cataloging and discover data. Often, metadata are intended for machine reading. It can be used to answer key questions including but not limited to 

- how the data was collected?
- when the data was collected?
- what variables/parameters are included in this dataset?
- if this is a geograhical data, what geographic region does this dataset cover?
- what is the quality of the dataset?
- who can use the data?
- who or which organization created or collected the data?
- how people can use the data?
- what is the version of the dataset?
- does the dataset follow any community or international standards or guidelines?
 
Metadata can be used for different purposes:

- Descriptive metadata can contain information about the context and content of your data; such as, abstract, title, subject key words.
- Structural metadata is used to describe the structure of the compound data (e.g., file format, the dataset heriachy).
- Administrative metadata explain the information that is used to manage the data (e.g., when and how it was created, which software and the version of the software used in data creation).


## 1.2 What is Open Data?

According to [an article in Paris Tech Review](http://www.paristechreview.com/2013/03/29/brief-history-open-data/), the term "open data" is quite new with the first appearance in 1995 describing the need of sharing Earth and environmental data becuase "our atmosphere, oceans and biosphere form an integrated whole that transcends borders." 

In here, we are adopting the definition of "open data" from [The Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/) from the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/).

> “Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.”

Once you pause and think about it, you may realise that open data is very common in the current society and you may have used some open data in your work already. Here, we shows you three selected examples of open data among many others.

> Open Data Example Box 1: Census survey data
> 
> Each country or territory often provides open access to a variety of socioeconomic information about the population, community, and business in its juristiction. These data are often called census survey data which may include the aggregated statistics of gender, racial, ethinicity, education, income, and health data of a community. These data are often used to understand the composition of a local neighborhood and are critical to inform decisions on resource allocation to ensure the quality of life for the community.  

> Open Data Example Box 2: First image of black hole
> 
> Scientists recently produced the [first image of a black hole in our galaxy](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/). This breakthrough scientific achievement is only possible through an open collaboration and sharing of telescope data observed by different observatories distributed across different parts of the world.


> Open Data Example Box 3: Open climate data
> 
> The changing climate poses significant risk to our daily lives, such as, intensifying drought, increasing occurence of flash flooding, and devastating fire incidents across the world. Open data are critical in providing life-saving information to adapt to the changing climate and help assess the climate risk of the place where we live. Government agencies (e.g., National Oceanic Atmospheri Administration in U.S., UK Met Office, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) have been providing public access to long-term weather and climate information for decades. Recently, organizations are developing value-added open data products to advise the society on the risk of changing climate. One recent example is the flood and fire risk in the United States developed by a non-profit organization [First Street Foundation](https://firststreet.org/data-access/)

## 1.3 Key characteristics of open data?

### Availability and accessibility

Availability and accessibility of data  mainly refers to publish the scientific research's data (e.g., scientific manuscript, research  data,  metadata,  open  educational  resources,  software,  and  source  code and hardware) and make it accessable over internet to download (Lesson 5). Open data offers all possible format that is human and machine readable. In general, this type of data requires no payment fee, but the infrastructure does have costs (paid by societies, institutes, organizarions etc.), especially when the data is available under some specific conditions (e.g., creative commons, licenses) (Link to Lession 5). There are several open data sources those are providing convenient and modifiable resources for multidisciplinary scientific research. As an example, the United States (U.S.) federal government provides free imagery developed by [Earth Observation satellites](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) (e.g., [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/), [MODIS](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/)) that automates data analysis and management practices in Earth science research (Zotti & La Mantia, 2014; Kavvada & Held, 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). This practice also inpired other space agencies worldwide to value the need of open access. 

### Reusability and distribution

Open data can be preserved from the begining, hence, the primary data remain protected throughout the data pipeline (Link to Lesson 4).The data is maintained on a regular basis, addressing feedback from different levels of users and provided with the history of available changes. It also contains all neccessary information that helps the user to utilize the data efficiently and independently (Link to Lesson 4). However, this is not the case for many large data, e.g., raw genomics reads are rarely ever preserved. Primary (raw) data from many instruments are also not preserved in many studies. Instead, data are calibrated and normalized at the instrument, corrected for a variety of adjustments, and then a processed data is reported and saved. There are discipline specific standards for this, usually known by domain repositories (link to Lesson 3)

Open data opens the scope of discovering new research methodogies and evaluating previous findings and restrictions. A better example of using open data is COVID-19 pandemic. When everyone needs to stay back home and reduce the transmission of the COVID-19, the researchers could able to reuse the available data instead of needing to rediscover every facet of their field. It allows them to find new perpectives and collaboarte with other scientists from interdisciplinary fields to handle this complex problem. 

The quality of the metadata affects open data reusability and distribution significantly. This has become a big concern with the increased interest in Open Data portals that have facilitated the access of large volumes of data online. No one size fits all for metadata, and its collection is guided by your data. There are schemas and standards that guide the metadata provided based on the discipline. Some examples are listed [here](https://libraryguides.vu.edu.au/research-data-management/metadataschemasandexamples). [Lesson 4.3](https://hackmd.io/oXZO8dtJT22aPjLxeAN5YQ#43-Documenting-your-Data-Metadata) provides a guide on what type of metadata should be provided for a dataset, and documentation. 

### Inclusivity

Data inclusivity refers to the openess of data that makes it available over public domains independent of nationality, location, race, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, income, socio-economic circumstances, career stage, discipline, language and culture, ability and disability, political ideology, ethnicity or immigration status or any  other grounds. Data will be free from all types of organizational, cultural, political and/or commercial restrictions (Link to Lesson 3). A good example is the [world bank proverty headcount data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=1W&start=1981&end=2015&view=chart), which is anonymously developed from primary household survey data of different government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments.
