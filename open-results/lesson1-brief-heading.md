General points on structure
Break up each lesson into a separate markdown document
Learning objective(s) listed at the top of each lesson file
References at the end of each lesson file
Cross-referencing between lessons on different modules 
<Module name> : <Lesson number> - <lesson name>
Single “files” directory for additional figures etc.
Summary rather than conclusions
Label each section of lesson 2.1, 2.2, etc.
Contributor list, like FAIR cookbook, but then without roles and alphabetical
