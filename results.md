# Open Results

Welcome to the Open Results Module! In Open Ethos we learned about the ethics and principles underlying responsible, open science practices. In Open Software we explored and identified the right tools and methods that allows us to ensure reproducibility through version control, code testing, workflow, and virtual research environment. In Open Data we developed a data management plan that can ensure Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) of our data throughout the research, and not just at the end when the final report from the project is released. In this module, we will explore the different stages of the research process - including identifying the different types of research objects in a study and the various ways in which they can be shared and disseminated.

We will provide an overview of the research lifecycle and research outputs (Lesson 1). We will discuss the different stages of the research process, from planning all the way through (and beyond) dissemination. Along the way we will consider what the results of your work are, the “objects” in a research study, and how they can be shared (Lessons 2-3). By the end of the module we will have looked at the important concepts and practices for publishing and sharing of research components before, during and after the project. Special attention will be given to ensuring ethical contributorship (i.e., making sure collaboration is fair, inclusive, and that credit is assigned transparently and equitably).


# Lesson 1: The Research Process and Its Results 


## Introduction 

With an overarching goal to maintain research integrity and ethical practices from the start, we need to consider reproducibility methods, collaborative approaches and transparent reporting for the research team to ensure that all results can be replicated and confirmed by independent researchers. First and foremost, this means: 1) broadening our perspectives regarding what shareable objects are produced throughout the research process, 2) providing sufficient documentation that describes the workflow and decision making process, and 3) publishing each of these research objects that would eventually enable others to validate the scientific outcomes. 

Accordingly, this lesson has two Learning Objectives. By the end of the lesson you will be able to answer:



1. What are the different stages of the research process?
2. What research objects can be considered a result?

## What are the different stages of the research process?

In Ethos, we learned about “planning for open science”. We learned that open science should be considered throughout the research process, and not just at the time of publication. Therefore, when considering open results, it is important to think about the entire research life cycle. Many of us might be very familiar with the research life cycle, but may not have considered what results could be considered open throughout it. Therefore, it is important to specifically define these _nine_ distinct phases: 


1. **Conceptualization/Ideation**

In this stage we focus on outlining and describing the research idea to different collaborators, students and/or postdocs. This could also encompass proposal writing, obtaining ethics approval documents, and/or securing funding.


2. **Planning**

In this stage we are thinking about project management and workflows. Who is needed for the research project to be successful? During the planning phase, collaborations are often extended beyond close collaborators. Methods of collaborations are often defined, including team member roles and responsibilities. 

3. **Project Design**

In this stage we are concerned with describing the research protocols. For example, how will the data be collected, and processed? Where will it be stored? At this phase, just before data collection, hypotheses may be **preregistered** [[Nosek et al. 2018](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1708274114)]. Preregristration differentiates research outcomes that are the results of predictions, which occur before data collection, from postdictions, which occur once the results of the data are obtained. 

4. **Data Collection**

In this stage data collection or data generation commence. See Open Data. 

5. **Data Wrangling and Processing**

At this stage, we use existing software, or write custom code in order to process the data that has been collected. See Open Software.

6. **Data Exploration and Statistical Analysis**

At this stage we combine the workflows from Stages 4 and 5 and begin using our tools, code or software to analyze the data that has been obtained. 

7. **Reporting**

Here we report on our findings. The most common form of reporting is publications in peer-reviewed journals. However, reporting now far exceeds publications alone. Reporting encompasses presentation materials (e.g. posters, slide decks), lab websites or blogs, social media (e.g. twitter threads), podcasts or press releases, and many more. 

8. **Preservation and Reuse**

In this phase, we consider archiving all outcomes for the long term sustainability. This ensures that our research is reusable, meaning that someone else can go through this whole process of reproducing or building upon our work.

9. **Scientific Engagement, Training, and Feedback (cross cutting)**

In this phase, we conduct effective collaboration through active engagement, skill development and peer-review processes for both direct and indirect stakeholders of your research. 

A depiction of these stages is provided in Figure 1 (below).

**Figure 1.**

![alt_text](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/research-cycle.jpg)


Although we describe these stages in a sequential order, these stages may not always be linear. For instance scientific engagement and data management efforts will be applied at all stages of research, data exploration, analysis and reporting will be an iterative process, and reporting will happen at different points of the research lifecycle.

To build high quality research outcomes, it is essential that everyone (1) can work together efficiently at all stages of the project, (2) have a shared understanding of how results from their work will be shared with each other, and more broadly beyond the project, and (3) get fairly recognized for all their contributions.


## What research objects are commonly associated with research stages?


### Digital Research Objects & Open Results

A **Digital** **Research Object (DRO)** can be composed of both research data and digital research objects. **Research data** consists of “_factual records (such as numerical scores, textual records, images, and sounds) resulting from research that is partially or fully funded by public funds, used as primary sources for scientific research, and that are commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings._” [(OECD, Recommendation of the Council concerning Access to Research Data from Public Funding OECD/LEGA/0347)](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0347). A **research-relevant digital research object** consists of any “_metadata, algorithms, workflows, models, and software (including code) resulting from research that is partially or fully funded by public funds, which are used in a research and development context_” [(OECD, Recommendation of the Council concerning Access to Research Data from Public Funding OECD/LEGA/0347)](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0347). 

Digital Research Objects are often given an identifier. In this way, there is a mechanism to trace back related resources about a scientific investigation. The most important aspects to consider about DRO’s:


* They are not only associated with the end products as publications and final reports, but also encompass research outputs created, revised and shared throughout the research lifecycle that help validate findings claimed in scholarly publications. More simply, DROs apply to any “single information unit” or research material that can be **shared and cited** with other scientists within and outside the project. 
* Motivation behind DRO is the need to identify and share all components such as data, source code, tools, method documentation, as well as communication materials such as presentations, videos, blogs and other tangible outcomes. 
* DROs facilitate reproducibility and reuse of the scientific methods and results through access to resources, context and metadata
* DROs help us to understand the entire research lifecycle through research outcomes including publications shared progressively. They also allow us to track the versioning and development of the entire project.

Ultimately, there are three guiding principles for DROs:

1. Digital identity - Using unique identifiers, such as DOIs (link to data) for tangible outcomes such as publications or data, and ORCID ids for researchers (explained in detail in the next lesson). This enables others to cite and use individual components of your work.
2. Data aggregation - Using a method to aggregate all outcomes so that they are discoverable and hence allow anyone to investigate and reproduce the research.
3. Annotation - Use rich machine-readable metadata (discussed in open data) that help ensure findability and accessibility of all scientific work.

Following from these we can now build a definition for an **Open Result. **An** Open Result **is all the research outcomes, including successful products, reports on potential risks, failed experiments or any other information such as experimental protocols, standards as well as all the individuals who contributed to the research can be recorded in the DRO and shared as open results.

Now that we understand what a digital research object is and what open results are, we can expand on how they operate in the context of the research lifecycle. The most important outcome to consider is that these DROs can be produced throughout the research lifecycle and do not have to be published at the end of the research process.

### Contributions that are not considered Digital Research Objects 

Research, like most technical professions, involves different kinds of contributions that do not result in tangible outcomes and hence, can’t always be defined by DRO. For example, responsibilities associated with maintenance of DRO, community management, data stewardship, library and archiving, EDI efforts, funding, project management, scientific event organization, training activities and more. Outcomes from these roles can not be always accurately captured besides documenting their processes, methods and impact, often recorded by some people involved in those roles. In Lesson 4, we discuss how to properly acknowledge the contributors to your results. 


## Assessment #1: Identify the research objects in case study 


## Self-assessment #2: Identify the research objects of a project you are/were involved in


## Conclusion 

Research consists of many different stages, each with a number of important parts. In the beginning, we were concerned with Conceptualization and Planning. This can include a number of different things - depending on the project - but typically involves the development of a study protocol, research questions, and other study materials. Next, comes Project Design. In this stage, we often focus on developing a study timeline (or roadmap), assigning different roles to project team members, creating data and meta-data management plans, and planning for data collection, management, and security. Next, is Data Collection. Taking a step back from a project can help us conceptualize this multifaceted process and give us an appreciation of all the important elements involved in bringing a project or study from conceptualization through to completion and dissemination. In the next lesson, we will consider the advantages - for ourselves and the broader scientific community - of making our results open and transparent. In doing so, we will explore best practices for transforming our work from closed to open.

# Lesson 2: Results in the Context of Open Science 


## Introduction 

In the previous lesson you learned that the results of a research project encompasses much more than just a published paper. In this lesson we will demonstrate the benefits and challenges of making your research results open. 

You will learn that making results open entails making them findable, reproducible, reusable and accessible while caring for both people and purpose. To this end, we will discuss available guiding principles to enhance the usefulness of your research results for you as a researcher, for your research team, your collaborators and for society in general. Applying these principles requires key changes in the practice and culture of research and the implementation and normalisation of certain technologies and practices that will be covered in the next two lessons as well. 

Some research projects produce sensitive research objects that cannot be shared due to ethical, legal, technical or institutional reasons. We will discuss how your research project can be reproducible and collaborative without necessarily having them all open.


## What are the **advantages** of making results open throughout the research process? 

In the Ethos module we discussed the general benefits of Responsible Open Science [add link]. In this section we will link how these advantages pertain to each ROs learned in Lesson 1. In order to simplify the discussion we will merge the possible ROs in four big categories:



* **Preparation documents.** This category includes all outcome ROs from the research project planning phases, e.g. Ideation & conceptualization, planning and project design
* **Datasets.** This includes raw or processed datasets from the following research stages: data collection, data wrangling and processing, and preservation and reuse. _Additional information about the advantages of making data open can be found in Lesson XXXX_
* **Software.** This refers to all the software created and used in all research stages, in particular: data collection, data wrangling and processing, data exploration & analysis and Preservation and reuse. _Additional information about the advantages of making software open can be found in Lesson XXXX as well._
* **Reports.** This category includes all ROs associated with communicating results within the research group or/and outside, e.g Communication, reporting and publications

The main identified advantages of making results open are the following:



1. **Avoid duplication efforts**. _This is important for all types of ROs_. 

    For example, a single dataset can be analysed in multiple ways. Another example is that the same implementation of the data processing, exploration and analysis stages (including analysis pipeline, statistical methods, tools, software, etc) can be reused for another phase of the same project or for a new project without the need of reimplementation by each researcher. 

2. **Saves time and increases efficiency.** _This is important for all types of ROs_. 

    If the research project is open from the start, it can help you to be more efficient and save a considerable amount of time (see Ethos section about “planning for open science”). First, having the preparation documents open will guarantee that all members in the team have at hand the information about the project design and planning big picture. Second, you save time when you are required to share your dataset, methods and software by funders and publishers. Third, an open workflow creates efficient pipelines from the start. Fourth, open ROs from the Engagement, feedback and reporting stages can also significantly improve the review process by validating the results available at each research stage within or outside your team. This improves replicability, as independent researchers can replicate and confirm the results at each step. Good and open documentation** **of data, codes and scripts, protocols and intermediate results will speed up writing your final papers/publications. 

3. **Facilitates collaboration and onboarding new members.** _This is also important for all ROs_. 

**Collaboration** will be much easier when preparation documents, dataset, methods and software are open and well documented. Having user testing, tutorials, executable notebooks and videos from the “Engagement, training, and feedback stage” will be additionally important for **onboarding** new members of your team or external collaborators. Your research project will be easier to be continued by you (even after some changes in the composition of your group) or by a different research group.



4. **Allows collaborators to receive credit, and provides incentives for others to contribute.** _This is important for all kinds of ROs_.

Making your results open also opens you up to clearer ways of **receiving credit **and can also reduce the risk of scooping (each result can be individually referenced as soon as made available) . Applying reproducibility practices separately on different parts of the project such as **Preparation documents, datasets, software and reporting** allow other researchers to test and reuse your work in their research, and your research will be more cited thus bringing fair recognition for your work. Collaborators can get more **motivated to contribute** because they can easily get recognition in terms of authorship for their contributions made for each one of the ROs generated. 



5. **Furthers the reach and audience of our results.** _This is particularly related with the Communication and collaboration, reporting and publishing steps_

Open posters/figures, talks/slides, preprints, webpages, journal/book publication will allow more members of your academic community to access your research, which in turn can turn into more collaboration and recognition and greater impact of your research results. But the impact can be extended outside the academic community as well by also making available public summary, lab website/blogs, social media, podcast/press release, citizen science projects among others which can strengthen the link with the local community and enrich your research.



6. **Funding.**  Since more and more funding agencies are paying attention to open science and requiring applying guiding open science principles to the research project they fund, open practices will make you **eligible for more funding opportunities**. 

The picture below summarises the most significant advantages for all actors in the research ecosystem of making your results open.

## What are potential obstacles and what resources are available to help overcome them? 


### Overall Potential Obstacles 

Along with all the clear benefits of open results, there are a suite of real and perceived challenges. These obstacles were described in the Ethos module and can be divided in two categories:



* External obstacles: **cultural barriers** (lack of support and recognition from your institution), **disagreement** between collaborators involved in the research on what results to make open, **legal **and **security **considerations;
* Internal obstacles: investment of **time** and **effort** needed upfront to make your results open including the need to learn additional **skills**, afraid of scooping, the lack of **funding** for instance for open-access publications and curating research results.

These obstacles apply for any Research Objects (created by you or your collaborators) e.g. data, software and documents, reports and publications. 

Let's focus on results that are not software or data. You can check the Data and Software modules for any questions specifically related to open data and software.  

One of the major steps in research is the communication of your ideas and insights from your work into a clear, open, and accessible format that can help key stakeholders make meaningful decisions. Mastering different ways to convey your insights responsibly is challenging and can be seen as a diversion to your research work: blogging, writing public summaries, podcasting, presenting posters and talks at conferences outside of your discipline, and using social media require communication skills that are not usually taught to students, and can be extremely time consuming while the impact is very difficult to measure.


### Obstacles and Recommendations for Open Access Reporting

The most common way to communicate research results is by far their publication in journals. However, the choice of a journal or a publishing platform may affect the availability and accessibility of the research results.  

Open Access publications allow you to make available articles and/or books accessible online, free of charge to the public without any restriction (no mandatory registration or login to specific platforms required). Publishing your results in Open access journal is a good way to increase your research impact and allows everyone, including society as a whole, to use your research results. 

However publishing open access can incur additional cost that may not be covered by your research grant or institution. Before publishing to a journal, check if there are institutional open access agreements in place: the costs are usually significantly reduced and sometimes you may be able to publish Open Access with no additional cost. Several publishers also offer waivers and discounts to researchers living in low- and middle-income countries. Other cost offsetting programs may be available too: for instance some publishers have a fee support program to ensure that accepted articles can benefit from open access.  

In many disciplines there are also Open Access Journals where the content is open for everyone, with no need to pay or be a member of a subscribing institution. The number of these journals is still increasing rapidly and you can search open access journals and articles in the Directory of Open Access Journals [DOAJ](https://www.doaj.org/).

You may choose to self-archive your research results to make them more discoverable and/or after you’ve published it in a subscription journal to ensure there is an open version of your paper. Preprint servers are also increasingly popular: you can deposit documents that have not been peer reviewed but are considered as a complete scientific publication in a first stage. Some of the preprints servers include open peer review services and the availability to post new versions of the initial paper once reviewed by peers. Preprints can be used to share a paper before it is submitted to a journal and can reduce scooping. Many publishers accept this as standard practice but some may reject papers which have been shared in preprint form. It's therefore important you read carefully the publisher policies when considering submitting a paper.

Finally, in most cases, you can also self-archive your publications in repositories, including [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). It is however recommended to check if the journal has any specific self-archiving policy. Your institution may also have an institutional repository. Check the [Registry of Open Access Repositories](http://roar.eprints.org/) to search and find an up to date list of available repositories.

More information about open access for other research objects like data and software can be found in Lessons XX and YY, respectively.


### Obstacles with being open when reusing closed ROs by others

We have detailed the most common challenges you may face when making your results open. Additional challenges arise when you reused closed Research Objects but want to make your results open. Below you will find examples and possible solutions to overcome these challenges. 



1. **Potential obstacle**: you do not get the consent from some of your collaborators for opening some datasets you have used in your analysis. 

    **Recommended solution**: you can create and share metadata (description of the content, data format, link to sample data files) instead. However, your results may not be reproducible. Therefore when sharing your workflows and software, it would be useful to provide sample datasets to demonstrate the reusability of your work. We recommend you agree early on (at the planning stage) on what datasets you will be using and whether they are open or will be opened (embargo);

2. **Potential obstacle**: your research work involves the usage of sensitive datasets that cannot be shared when publishing. 

    **Recommended solution**:  make sure to detail clearly the protocol used to collect the dataset and the condition of access. Ensure you have metadata to increase the FAIRness of your work. You may also want to provide sample datasets (anonymized, etc.) to ease reuse and support the creation of derivative work.

3. **Potential obstacle**: the software you have used for your analysis is not open. This will of course limit the reproducibility of your results to those who can access the software you used.

    **Recommended solution**:  If it is a commercial software, you can add metadata information such as the software name, version, prerequisites (see software module)  to help others to identify and possibly buy the very same software. The more costly the software is, the less likely your research results will be reproduced and reused. When the software is closed and/or available at a cost, it is recommended to add sufficient information on the algorithm used to make it more accessible. If possible provide, for instance, containerized executable versions or offer an online service to run the software. Whenever you start a project, you should assess the tools you would need and evaluate the impact of using close or commercial software.



## What are the guiding principles to turn a research result into an open result?

Following the FAIR principles (see Ethos module) ensures research results are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. This is one of the prerequisites to make research results open and available to everyone. The CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics) are also detailed in the Ethos module and complement the FAIR principles: they are people and purpose-oriented and aim at advancing the Indigenous peoples’ rights and self-determination.

For Data and/or Software Research Objects, you can read the Data and Software Modules, respectively. Other types of Research Objects such as your planning and research results documents (Data Management Plan, project proposals, blogs, videos) and publications need to follow the FAIR principles to allow others to understand your work and eventually derive new creative work.

Before learning how to ensure your research results are FAIR, let’s clarify the concept of FAIR and highlight the differences between FAIR and Open.

**FAIR for Closed Research Objects**

Ideally, you would like to make your Research Objects FAIR and Open. However, it is not always possible. For instance, whenever you have sensitive data or cannot distribute data (e.g., it could harm or target specific people or identify the location of endangered species or animals), you can generate sufficient metadata to make your research object FAIR while keeping the data itself closed. Therefore, Research Objects can be **FAIR but not open**. 

**FAIR for Open Research Objects**

Openness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maximum reuse. When the content of Research Objects can be made open without harming anyone and with the consent of all the contributors, ensuring their FAIRness increases reproducibility and reuse. 


### Transforming an “unFAIR” to “FAIR” result

Here we will explore two scenarios:



1. The Research Object is not yours
2. The Research Object has been created by you and your research team.


#### Turning someone else Research Object into FAIR result



* Check the license of the Research Object: if you cannot share the content, you can still create metadata.
* Add metadata (authors information, size of the Research Object, contact information, title, description, location such as a persistent identifier or Digital Object Identifier) with detailed information of the Research Object itself. 
* Deposit the Research Object (if it can be re-distributed) in a repository where you can add metadata and get a persistent identifier such as Zenodo or a community specific repository. If the Research Object itself cannot be redistributed, create a record in a repository such as Zenodo where you can add as much metadata as necessary for others to understand and potentially request the Research Object itself.


#### Turning your Research Object into FAIR result



* Check the colours of your figures and tables and change them to make it colourblind friendly (see for instance [https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)).  
* Check that making available your research results will not potentially harm anyone. In doubt, do not open the particular research result. 
* Tidy your project structure to use descriptive file names and logical folder structure. For a good summary of what makes for good file names and folders.
* Add a README file to your folders to explain what they contain. 
* Move data saved in proprietary formats to open standards (for instance, move files saved in DOCX format to RTF or HTML).
* Add code and code documentation, with descriptions of what each function does, what are their inputs and outputs, and include examples. 
* When publishing data, add an example on how to read/analyse the data.
* Upload reports in open archives. 
* Choose Open-Access platforms that give free and online availability of research outputs.
* Publish a blog or a video abstract in simple language for the layperson. 
* Link all the contents of your research outputs as an aggregated Research Object. 
* Add relevant metadata (add effective title/names, description and keywords) to each of your research output;
* Deposit the aggregated Research Object into a repository that can deliver persistent identifiers such as Digital Object Identifier.


### The continuum from closed to open

All research results rest on a scale between closed and open because there are variances in how information is shared and the reasons to share. Your research results can be:



1. **Closed**. It is only available to certain individuals within an organization. It is patented or proprietary. 
2. **Mediated**. It is semi-restricted to certain groups or it is open to the public through a licence fee or other pre-requisite. As we have discussed in previous sections, there are legitimate reasons to restrict the access to data and when data is mediated possible users must request access. For example, health-related information collected by a hospital or insurance carrier
3. **Embargoed**.  The result will be open in the future. For example, some groups might release their data following an appropriate latency period to allow thorough understanding of the data as well as to allow time for the scientific exploitation of the data by the research team. 
4. **Open**. It is accessible in a readable format and licensed as open source.

And there are many setups in between these four categories! 


### Bundling your Research Objects

To work Open you may have created different Research Objects such as data, software and workflows. The Data and Software modules explained how to deal with these research results and obtained for instance Digital Object Identifiers for each of them. When publishing,  additional material can be added (software, data, workflows, etc.) but you usually limit the Research Objects to what is discussed in the paper. Failures, dead-ends and other trials and errors are part of the research process and usually do not have their place in scientific publication. To ease re-use and facilitate the creation of derivative work, you can aggregate all your research objects to create bundles that represent the entire research process and not only the selected positive results.


## Assessment: Case study analysis



1. Building on self-assessment #2 in Lesson 1. Which of those elements were guided by FAIR principles? 
2. Flag the research objects you think could benefit from FAIR principles. 
3. Rank order those objects from “would benefit most from FAIR principles” to least
4. Rank order those objects from “would require most resources” to least 
5. Identify a few research objects that strike a balance between high priority and resources required 

 


# Lesson 3: Applying Open Result Framework to your Research 


## Introduction 

After the previous section, you’re probably raring to go to make your research objects as findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable as you can. But how can you go about actually doing so? In this section we will delve deeper into the practical issues of open results and introduce some specific tools and services that will get you 80% of the way there. 

Bear in mind that no tool is optimal in every context. All recommendations made in this lesson are based on what is generally useful but might not be ideal for your particular domain of research, institutional context, culture or legal framework. When in doubt, you can ask the relevant people in your institution, your colleagues and your peers what tools are available, validated and recommended.

Also of note, these tools are not neutral. All of them are developed and maintained by people in the english-speaking developed world, which charge them with biases and assumptions that might not be relevant for your own situation. 


## How to apply an open framework across different research objects

An Open result is the aggregation of all the research objects introduced in the last lesson (software, data, workflows, reporting, documents). Ideally, to open your research results you would need to open each Research Object that you can legally and ethically open and agrregate them into your final Research result. The approach you need to follow to open an individual Research Object is independent of the type of Digital Research Object (DRO) even though the tools may be very different. Below we introduce the main concepts that are necessary to open your Research Objects. Later, we will go through each type of Research results (document-RO, data-RO, executable-RO, reporting-RO) and learn the most popular tools you can use.


### Unique identifiers

Perhaps the single most important step to make your results open is to assign them a globally unique and persistent identifier. This will give you a single code, URL or number that you can use to uniquely refer to the research object unambiguously. Any derived research object can use this identifier to link to it and create a traceable and rich history of use and development. Crucially, this identifier can be used by others to cite and credit your work. 

The identifier must also be persistent. This guarantees that the identifier points to the same research object for a long time. What counts as “persistent” is, of course, a matter of degree since even the most stable identifier probably won’t survive the Sun engulfing the Earth in a few billion years. In this context, “persistent” implies that it is registered in a database managed by an organisation or system that is committed to maintain it stable and backwards compatible for the foreseeable future. 

For example, URLs are notoriously not persistent since they can change their contents frequently or become invalid without maintenance. On the other hand, Journal publications have a Digital Object Identifier, whose persistence is guaranteed by the International DOI Foundation. 

As well as uniquely identify each research object, it is important to be able to uniquely identify and cite all the authors and contributors. For this, it is recommended to get the permanent digital ID of each of the authors and contributors. [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is an online service where you can get a permanent digital identifier.

Exercise:

(multiple choice) Select which of the following are globally unique and persistent identifiers:



* ✅ Digital Object Identifier 10.1371/journal.pone.0230416 
    * The Digital Object Identifier is provided by the International DOI Foundation, which ensures that each ID is unique and ensures that a DOI link always links to the correct object. 
* ❌ [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)  
    * This is the URL of a GitHub repository. The contents of the repository can drastically change over time and the owner can delete it completely. 
* ✅ ISBN-13: 978-0735619678
    * This is an International Standard Book Number, which has to be purchased by publishers by the International ISBN Agency.
* ✅ [https://web.archive.org/web/20220121051903/https://www.go-fair.org/](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121051903/https://www.go-fair.org/) 
    * The Internet Archive captures snapshots of websites and their links are really stable. Even if not ideal, it’s a handy tool for creating identifiers of websites easily. 


### Metadata

The second step to make your research objects open is to produce textual information _about_ the research object (metadata) and link it to it. These metadata serve both humans and machines. For humans, having metadata is imperative to ease understanding. For example, it can contain variable names contained in a dataset, physical units of a variable of a dataset, the software used to generate and/read the dataset, the training method of a machine learning model, the sampling method used for a particular dataset. For machines, metadata is useful for indexing and searching, as well as programmatically interacting with digital research objects. To be “understood” by machines, metadata must follow established conventions and/or standards that are often domain specific. To make your data, software, workflow interoperable, mapping metadata standards from different disciplines and/or creating cross-disciplinary standards is often necessary but a very complex procedure. 

In general, try to think about what information you would need to have in order to know if that research object is relevant to your needs. However, some metadata information that applies to almost any research object are:



* Title: A short but descriptive sentence that introduces the research object. 
* Description: A longer text with a more thorough description of the research object. This might include descriptions of the process that created it, important caveats or limitations, and anything that you think would be useful to contextualise it. 
* Authors: A list of people responsible for creating the research object and who should be credited if it is used. 
* Contributors: A list of people who contributed to populate the content of the Research Object and/or the original authors when you create derivative work from another existing Research Object.
* Date of creation / publication: Try to use an unambiguous date format like the ISO 8601 year-month-day format. 
* Version: a number or other sort of ID that helps disambiguate between different versions of the research object, in case it is updated (for instante, if you found an error after publishing it). 

As mentioned earlier, many domains have adopted formal metadata standards. To facilitate interoperability between domains the Research Data Alliance (RDA) develops and maintains [the RDA Metadata Standards Catalog](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/), a collaborative, open directory of metadata standards applicable to research data. 

These guidelines we give for each type of Research Object are not domain specific and should be considered as the minimum required for making your research results open. In any case, metadata should always be open even though you cannot share the associated content (for instance for sensitive datasets and/or closed software).

Exercise: 

(multiple choice) Select which pieces of information would be included in the metadata of a dataset of species, sex, body mass, height, flipper length, bill length measured at three Antarctic Islands



* ✅ Date of the data collection. 
    * When the data was collected can be important for ecological/longitudinal studies. 
* ✅ Geographical coordinates of each island. 
    * The location of the islands can be used for spatial analysis and also for indexing. 
* ❌ Average height of all penguins. 
    * This can be computed from the data itself.
* ✅ Make and model of the scale used to collect weight measurements. 
    * Instrument details are important to assess the quality of the measurements. 
* ✅ Filename and extension of the files.
    * Descriptive filenames are very useful for humans to understand the contents of a file and can contain important information, such as dates or locations. The file extension can be used as a good heuristic to know how to read its contents.
* ✅ Software name and version.
    * Descriptive information about the software you used for producing and/or analyzing data is crucial for reuse. See “Software module” for more comprehensive information about Software release, documentation, testing, etc.


### Licences/Rules for reuse

Another very important element to include with your research objects are clear rules for reuse (as is and for creating derivative work), which are often and most easily codified by the use of licences. 

Without a licence, all rights are with the author of the research result, and that means nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify the work without consent. A licence gives this consent. If you do not have a licence for each of the research objects that constitute your research result, it is effectively unusable by the whole research community.

Choosing a licence is not always straightforward, especially since your institution might have legal requirements. If you are using other people’s work, you also need to pay attention to their licences and choose one that is compatible. Different types of licences can be used and the choice also depends on the type of Research Object: licences for software (executable research object) are very different than for documents. We recommend checking the Data module, software module to get a better understanding of the licences you can use for each type of Research Objects. In this lesson, we will recommend the most common approach for each type of RO.

To guide you in your choice, you can use Choose a licence website: [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

For instance, if your Research Object is not software, attaching a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International gives permission to anyone to share and modify your research object as long as they credit you. 

In the context of Research Results, we also recommend being consistent in the usage of the licences for all the different Research Objects you aggregate into your final Research results. For instance, if you choose a permissive licence  for your dataset but a closed licence for the software needed to read the data, you significantly reduce the usage of your dataset.


## How to share your results, and select tools that support open science?

Here we will go through each stage of the research cycle defined in the categories of Lesson 2 and discuss how you can share each of the components. First it is important to understand: what is a repository, and why it is important to register research objects in a searchable resource:


### Repositories

All the above needs services that can assign unique identifiers and link them to the research objects and associated metadata, including the licences. Repositories are services that cover all those bases. 

Zenodo is a very popular repository (Yeston 2021) in which you can register metadata and obtain a Digital Object Identifier, as well as host digital objects such as data, code and publications. 

[RoHub](https://reliance.rohub.org/) is a Research Object registry where you can create Research Objects and aggregate Research results stored/deposited on different repositories.


### Registering in a searchable resource. 

If you use a service such as Zenodo and/or RoHub, your Research results will be automatically searchable, for instance in [EOSC Explore](https://explore.eosc-portal.eu/). 

Being able to find a research object and understand its contents through its metadata is a great step. But it can be lost if the person who found the data is not able to access it. 

For humans, providing detailed information on where to start, what to look at in the aggregated Research results as well as in each Research Object, is key. Then, as mentioned earlier, pay attention to the font, colours (colourblind friendly palettes) and overall use of simple sentences that can be understood by non-english natives are a few of the recommendations you can follow. When a Research Object has private content (such as sensitive data), it is important to provide as much details as necessary to let other researchers know how to request data (clearance procedures, instructions on how to register and authenticate to servers hosting the data, etc.). For machines, standardized APIs (Application Programming Interface) are necessary to be able to access the metadata and data programmatically. 

As before, while we will point you to solutions that can work a lot of the time, we encourage you to check with your institution, which might already have infrastructure set up. Also check which repository is mostly used in your community. 

As you know from Lesson 1, the scope and variety of research objects is extremely large, so it’s impossible to give guidelines (even brief ones) for all of them. Below we focus on four broad types of research objects. 


### Documents

Sharing all the documentation related to a project helps other researchers to understand the objectives and can bring further collaborations. Try to make open everything needed for your research project proposal, planning and during execution: Proposal, ethics approval, preregistration, project planning, Data management plans.

Recommended tools:



* Upload to Zenodo with CC-BY 4.0 license for archiving and long-term preservation.
* Use Google docs or Overleaf for collaboration.


### Data

Sharing data, especially large data, is not a solved problem (see the Open Data section for more in-depth guidance). But if your datasets are small enough and don’t carry privacy issues, it’s relatively straightforward to upload them to a repository. Zenodo (zenodo.org) allows you to upload datasets of up to 50Gb (larger datasets can be hosted but you need to ask permission) and it provides you with a unique identifier as well as a whole set of metadata. 

Choose a format that is simple to use and read. Make sure to use a data format that can be read with free software and prefer open standards to closed formats (e.g. plain csv files are better than excel). If there is a trade-off between efficient storage and ease of use, prioritise accessibility, since storage is generally cheap. Some research communities have developed or embraced particular formats as their standards so your data will be much more accessible to your intended audience if you adapt to those. 

Recommended tools:



* Upload to Zenodo. Check if both the data and metadata can be shared and open and whenever you can use CC-BY-4.0 license. The repository allows for datasets as large as 50Gb. Larger datasets can be hosted if you ask. 
* Check if your domain has some standard and a domain specific repository. 

Which licence?


### Software

If your analysis is code-centric, one of the best steps you can take to make your code more open is to develop it in a repository with a version control system. This will not only add transparency to the process, but make collaboration much easier (after the initial investment in learning the new tool). 

GitHub (github.org) is one popular remote repository system for open source projects. You can create repositories for your projects that can even be private and with special permissions for internal collaborators. 

A GitHub repository is not an archival service nor does it provide an unique and persistent identifier. To release your code, you need to create a stable snapshot. To do this, you can connect Zenodo to your GitHub account to create DOIs of specific snapshots.

Besides where to host the code, an important aspect is the documentation. The single most helpful piece of documentation is to include a README file that explains what the code does, how it can be installed and how it’s used. To encourage collaboration from outside sources, you can also include contribution guidelines. 

Recommended tools:



* Host your code on GitHub for development and collaboration. 
* Connect your github repository to Zenodo and create software releases (snapshots) to get their own DOI for release. 

Exercise:

Think of a specific research object from a project you are / were involved in and use [https://readme.so/editor](https://readme.so/editor) to create a README template that applies to it.


### Reports

As a scientist you are probably trained to write and publish papers. However, traditional publishing outlets are not open, since they require hefty subscriptions fees or per–article payments.

Publishing your articles in an Open Access journal might be the easiest option to make documents open, but most Open Access journals charge article processing fees that can be prohibitively high. A free alternative is to upload your manuscript to a preprint server, where you can upload manuscripts before acceptance to a journal.

A very popular and long-running preprint server is ArXiv ([http://arxiv.org/](http://arxiv.org/)). ArXiv is mainly used by physics and computer science, so you might want to search for a more specialised one for your community. For biology, there’s bioRxiv (biorxiv.org/) and for Earth sciences there's EarthArXiv ([https://eartharxiv.org/](https://eartharxiv.org/)). Some journals provide one-click pre-print services upon submission. 

If you or your team have a website, consider uploading your report there. Although simple, the main disadvantage of this is that an unstructured website doesn’t provide unique identifiers and stable links like a preprint server does. 

Something important to consider is what are you allowed to do with a manuscript that is published in a journal. Some journals don’t allow you to make the final copy-edited version public, or even the version with changes based on peer-review. 

Beyond publications, you probably want to communicate your research work to a larger audience. Writing blogs, developing tutorials and/or making short videos are becoming more and more popular, and an integral part of the research work.

Recommended tools:



* Upload to a preprint server such as ArXiv. Ask around in your community for a more specialised server. 
* Upload the report, videos, blogs, etc. to your personal or institutional website. 


### Putting everything together

Each individual Research Object is now FAIR or as FAIR as you can, and now it is time to create one aggregated Research Object that constitutes your final research result (final being here used as complete).

The creation of this aggregated Research Object could be as simple as a single text or markdown file with all the links to each individual Research results. You can upload that file on your personal or team website. 

However, a more structured alternative is to use a registry of Research Objects such as [RoHub](https://reliance.rohub.org/) ([https://reliance.rohub.org/](https://reliance.rohub.org/)). There you can and add links to all the individual Research Objects that constitute your research result. The type of Research Object depends on the main constituents of your final Research Result. We usually recommend creating an executable Research Object for aggregating all your research results. Each Research Object has a persistent identifier. Once created and ready to be published, you can make snapshots and ultimately archive your Research Object to get a Digital Object Identifier. When you create a Research Object in RoHub, it is harvested in OpenAire and your research result is automatically searchable in [EOSC Explore](https://explore.eosc-portal.eu/).

Examples



* Executable Research Object “[Cosmos-UK soil moisture (Jupyter Notebook) published in the Environmental Data Science book](https://w3id.org/ro-id/435f534c-e49b-43c3-9bd6-3393100bef3f)” 
* Data-centric Research Object “[Mean ground velocities from ALOS-2 data at Changbaishan volcano (China/North Korea) during 2018-2020](https://w3id.org/ro-id/61bceafe-5b48-4548-8caf-4142153b1b1b)”
* Bibliography-centric Research Object “[The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic seen through the lens of the Italian university teachers and the comparison with school teachers' perspective](https://w3id.org/ro-id/e1d32110-086e-4de3-80b2-21dfe6ae068a)”

Recommended tools:



* Create a Research Object in RoHub (https://reliance.rohub.org/)


### As open as possible as restricted as necessary

Reproducibility, and therefore FAIR, should be considered as a guiding principle in all stages of your research process. But reproducibility does always mean open. We share the idea that research should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary (Turning FAIR into reality, EC, 2018). Open principles should be applied when you can and never for private, confidential or sensitive results. 

This does not contradict all what you have learned so far in this module because FAIR does not require your research objects to be open but it requires open metadata and open standards for interoperability.


## Using a checklist to achieve open results

The first step to make your Research results open is to register to [ORCID ](https://orcid.org/)to get a permanent digital ID for yourself. We also strongly encourage you to ask all your collaborators to do the same.

The table below summarises the some initial steps that correspond to the [Minimum Viable Solution] (see lesson 2) to make your Research result open. You need to apply these recommendations for each Research Object that is part of your Research results.

## Assessment: case study analysis 

1. From Lesson 3, consider the three highest priority research objects that could benefit from openness:
* Identify possible platforms where these research object could be hosted 
* Identify any modifications to this research objects that would enable it to abide by principles of openness 



# Lesson 4: Providing Equitable Opportunities and Credit for Contributors to Results


## Introduction

“What Des-Cartes did was a good step. You have added much several ways, & especially in taking the colours of thin plates into philosophical consideration. If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” 
- Turnbull, H. W. ed., 1959. The Correspondence of Isaac Newton: 1661–1675, Volume 1, London, UK: Published for the Royal Society at the University Press. p. 416

If you are a researcher, regardless of your career stage, chances are you are not working alone. And even if you are working alone on any given project, it is very likely that your work builds on the work of others. And just like that, others after you will build on your work, advancing our understanding of the world and beyond.

In the previous lessons of this module we defined open results and talked about ways you can frame your research so that all your outputs are open. We have also spent some time explaining why sharing your results openly avoids duplicative work, saves time and increases efficiency, and facilitates collaboration and onboarding of new members.

In this lesson, we will talk about authorship and contributorship, dive deeper into why open results matter, specifically talking about how being open with your results can open up doors to unforeseen opportunities for collaborations. We will also provide you with guidelines on how to ensure contributions to your current or future work happen easily and fairly, maximizing the chances of a successful collaboration. Finally, we will briefly go over how you can contribute to others’ open results in a way that prioritizes helping your fellow colleagues improve their work.


## How to define contributors to each research object and determine their suitable form of credit?


### Defining authors and contributors to your project

Too often conversation about contribution and authorship takes place towards the end of a project or right when a scientific publication is drafted. However, as we learned in the previous lessons, research outputs are generated throughout the lifetime of a research project. In order to share them as open results in different stages of research, we should build an agreement for how authorship and contributorship in the project will be managed. This requires collaboratively defining what is considered authorship in your project, who among the current contributors is going to get authorship, who will get acknowledged as a contributor, who goes first and last in the list of a scientific publication, and who makes these decisions.

First and foremost, we need to remember that _anyone_ who has contributed to the research project must have their contributions recognized. With that shared understanding, in this lesson we will explore what those recognitions as contributors or authors in your research project might look like.

First, let’s define what a contributor is:

A **contributor** of a research output is an individual who has contributed to any activity that made it possible for the open result to be published or shared. This includes the person(s) who first conceptualized the idea and designed the work, the project lead, external advisors, general mentors, the students, researchers, research assistants who conducted or helped conduct the experiments, the people who set up the tools essential for conducting the research, data stewards, the software developers, support staff, the project management team, the colleague(s) who provided feedback to the open results, as well as any collaborator. [[reference](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/shared-ownership/shared-ownership-projects.html)]

Depending on the type of contribution, some of these people should be recognized as authors of the open result, while the others are appropriately acknowledged as contributors. 

Now, let's define authorship: 

According to the definition provided by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) which is widely accepted in biomedical disciplines:

An **author** of an open result is a contributor who has given substantial contribution to the conception or design of the work or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data for the work. Additionally, an author is a contributor who has contributed to drafting or revising critically the work providing important intellectual content. An author is also someone who has approved the final version of the open result and agrees to be accountable for all aspects of the work and for the integrity of all other co-authors. [[reference](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html)]

There are several other definitions of authorship which vary across disciplines and describe how they relate to different research outputs. For instance, the [COPE Authorship Discussion Document](https://publicationethics.org/files/COPE_DD_A4_Authorship_SEPT19_SCREEN_AW.pdf) indicates that minimum requirements for authorship is 1) substantial contribution to the work and 2) accountability for the work conducted and shared in a publication. Authoring a research manuscript that is published in a peer-reviewed journal, for example, is widely considered one of the most valuable currencies for career advancement, promotion, funding opportunities, and overall chance of being recognized by the research community. 

Given the weight traditionally placed on authorship  in scientific publication and the fuzziness of the definitions (that often contain words such as “substantial” or “extensive” leaving too much room for interpretation), it is not surprising that determining who amongst the contributors gets to be an author can lead to biased or unfair decisions, disputes between contributors, or at the very least leave someone resentful and feeling unappreciated. 

To avoid these challenges, in the next section we are going to provide some tips on how to determine who amongst the contributors is recognized as author, as well as how to ensure all contributions to the open result are recognized fairly.


### How to fairly determine authorship

We established that _all_ _contributors to an open result should be acknowledged for their contributions_. That said, the first decision to make as a team is who amongst the contributors gets to be recognized as author. Then, we need to make sure all the other non-author contributors are properly acknowledged in the open result (next section).

The National Institute of Health (NIH) provides a useful schematic representation to help with the first decision: 

![alt_text](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780128499054000034-u03-01-9780128499054.jpg)


Even if guidelines like this one to help establish authorship and contributorship exist (see others cited below), it is rarely an easy “black and white” (or in this case, “purple and green”) decision. The power imbalance between project leads and students, for example, can often mean that who is treated unfairly is the contributor with the least power. 

Power dynamics amongst the team of contributors need to be acknowledged and discussed openly. Hierarchies and power imbalances can be due to many factors. The most obvious and somewhat accepted in academia is levels of seniority: those with more experience, those who have been around longer tend to hold the most power. But there are other, sneakier factors that are the legacy of a whole set of systems and structures that have oppressed groups of people for as long as we can remember. Academia and science are no exception. These systems of oppression include sexism, racism, white supremacy, heterosexism, ableism, and many more. It is important to recognize the implications of living in a society that is built on and around those systems, and to become aware of the resulting biases that may consciously or unconsciously affect our choices. 

We can even go further and try our best to correct for those biases by intentionally deciding to make up for some of the inevitable shortcomings to which we may be unaware or may not have the lived experience of. 

That is bringing an equity lens to our work. 

Equity is another word for fairness or ​​leveling the playing field. **Equity** is an approach that recognizes that the magnitude of systemic barriers posed to a particular person will vary based on their gender identity, race, geographic location, class, age, ability, sexual orientation and other factors. Equity recognizes that different people will need different amounts of resources or support in order to succeed and overcome these barriers. 

If you decide to bring an equity lens to this discussion, consider how you, with your powers and privileges, may be able to help others get a seat at the table. Let’s say, for example, that you are a postdoc and the leading author of a research project. A rotating student spends 4 months in the lab helping you set up and perfect the experimental protocol that you will then use to carry out the experiments needed to answer your research question. They may even help you collect some preliminary data, but then they leave and later decide to join another lab. It may be tempting to not include them as authors in the final work and not even acknowledge them as contributors—which would be unethical. However, if you think that they have provided significant help and contributed to the success of your experiment, you should consider giving them authorship, perhaps contacting them to help write the methods section of the manuscript. You would give this student a huge opportunity to be cited and seen as a professional researcher. 

Another aspect that can lead to unfair and unethical authorship recognition is the position of the author in the author list. Usually the first author slot is reserved to the main contributor who has provided the largest contribution to the open result, someone who has been responsible for the work ideation, implementation, and completion carrying it all the way to publication. The last author is generally the group leader or principal investigator who has overseen the project from ideation to completion, providing mentorship and substantial contribution to the open result composition. The authors in the middle tend to be grouped as all the other contributors who have passed the “authorship test”, while disregarding the specific contribution each of them made to the project. Once again it seems that even if a contributor is recognized as an author, every time an open result is set to be published or shared, there is an opportunity for genuine mistake, misunderstandings, and even plain exploitation and unethical behavior [Fleming, N. (2021). The authorship rows that sour scientific collaborations. Nature, 594, 459–462. doi: 10.1038/d41586-021-01574-y]. 

One of the best ways to avoid conflicts and unfair authorship assignments is to_ be intentional about it and plan ahead _by creating an authorship and contributorship document or guideline for your project_! _

Below are some tips to guide you in implementing your version of a more ethical and just authorship assignment approach by **establishing authorship and contributor guidelines for your research group.** 



* **Search for existing guidelines** (some are linked in this lesson) and use them as a starting place to create your own set of guidelines. In doing so, seek advice from librarians and open science professionals at your research institute.
* **The guidelines should include language to help guide the discussion around explicit recognition of power dynamics.** These are not easy conversations and having language in the guidelines that acknowledges the need for having a conversation around power dynamics helps make it happen as part of the shared norms of the group. This can include prompts to assess the position of the contributor within the team (_e.g._, the principal investigator (PI) whose name is attached to the the grant funding, the student who just joined the group, the staff scientist who has worked in the lab for 4 years, etc.) and their role and responsibilities in the context of the project implementation (the student is the one who wrote the first draft of the research proposal and is going to carry out the experiments, the PI co-wrote and submitted the research proposal and will supervise the whole project, the staff scientist is the one who is going to carry on the statistical analysis, the postdoc is going to help mentor the new student and teach them the technique, etc.). 
* **Make sure all members of your research group have the opportunity to contribute to the guidelines.** You can draft the initial document, but then ask for constructive and honest input from the other members of your team. If new members join, make sure they are properly onboarded and have a chance to comment on the existing guidelines, especially if they are brought in as contributors to an ongoing project. 
* **Re-evaluate and seek explicit agreement over the guidelines at the beginning of every new research project.** If someone does not agree to the guidelines, try to mediate an open conversation around why they don’t agree, trying to find a common ground amongst the contributors. If the disagreement remains, you can consider having your team vote and follow what the majority choses. 
* **The guidelines should include instructions for contributors on how to report unethical deviations from the policy** to someone other than the group leader (this could be the Chair of the department, a dedicated office at the research institution, or the funder of the project).
* **At the time of publication of the open result check for any existing policy associated with the platform used for publication (_e.g_., a journal).** If the policy does not align with yours, present your reasoning and negotiate with the platform. Also make sure that if the criteria you use to determine authorship deviate, you have a space to clearly state the change in the open result.
* **Make the guidelines publicly available.** If you have a group’s website you can post it there, and/or you can decide to create a version of record and point to a permanent identifier such that the link never breaks by publishing the guidelines on a public repository (_e.g_., Zenodo).

Speaking of power imbalances, one thing you may be wondering if you are not the group leader is, _how on earth am I going to bring this up to my research group who is not at all on board with open science practices or simply has never thought of having explicit authorship and contributorship guidelines? _Well, there is no one right way to do this, but one suggestion we can give you is to learn about it and then present an outline of the guidelines to your next group meeting. Even if the work should not be on one person, oftentimes the main barrier to having something done is that initial activation phase, creating that initial draft to which others can contribute. So, if you are up for it and are committed to implementing open results practices, we recommend that you take that first step and then try to persuade others to join in. In most cases, your colleagues will be grateful and hopefully contribute to composing the guidelines.

* The Contributor Roles Taxonomy or CRediT ([https://credit.niso.org/](https://credit.niso.org/)) is a high-level taxonomy that is increasingly being used to attribute different kinds of contributions made to scientific scholarly output. These include ​​​​conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, supervision, validation, visualization, writing of original draft, reviewing, and editing. In practice, success of this authorship approach relies on all authors openly acknowledging the importance of everyone’s contributions [[reference](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/highlighting-authors-contributions-and-interdisciplinary-collaborations-in-living-with-machines)].

In the next section, we provide information on how to create **contributor guidelines** as a way to a) acknowledge non-author contributors, and b) invite others who are not currently part of the research team to contribute to your project.


## How to create contributor guidelines that ensure equity, access, inclusion, diversity


### Contributor guidelines

In addition to providing guidelines on how to assign authorship, you also want to have a system in place to fairly recognize the contributions of the non-author contributors. Additionally, you may want to consider guiding contributions to your results after they are made open. Let’s take a look at how you can go about this.


#### **Crediting non-authors project contributors**

The CRediT taxonomy captures some of those “non-author contributors” roles such as funding acquisition and project administration, but there is more to open results than scholarly outputs. This may include work associated with maintenance, community management, data stewardship, library and archiving, equity, diversity and inclusion efforts, funding, project management, scientific event organization, training activities and more. We must ensure that there are processes in place to acknowledge, value and reward these hidden labor. [Reference: D'Ignazio, C., & Klein, L. (2020). 7. Show Your Work. Data Feminism. PubPub. [https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0vgzaln4/release/3](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0vgzaln4/release/3)]. 

You can consider adding a section to your authorship guidelines that specifically talks about how you will acknowledge non-authors contributors to different components of your open results. See below for some example language.


#### **Inviting others to provide feedback and contribute**

Often in academia external feedback is not sought out until we submit our manuscripts for publication to a journal or a conference in which case 2-3 reviewers, presumably experts in the field, are recruited by an editor to anonymously review your work. The process of peer review is a much dreaded one as the expectation tends to be the one that feedback will set us back, keeping us from publishing our work, attending a conference. 

But it does not have to be that way. 

Together, we can build a future in which feedback from outside of those who are directly involved in the project is sought out sooner and is welcomed with a much more positive attitude. Of course, what you don’t want is to get showered with non constructive attacks, which is why it is important that you set the rules for contributions. 

**Contributor guidelines** are documents that are often used in open source projects to guide potential project contributors in providing feedback. They contain information about the project itself, links to various parts of the project, and, most importantly, a detailed description of _how_ to report errors (often called bugs in code jargon), suggest changes, and even request integration of large parts of code. 

In the context of scientific research, the practice of having a document that accompanies results and explicitly states how and what type feedback should be provided is not common. However, when you begin to make more and more of your results open at different stages of your research cycle, you may want to invite feedback to aspects of your work that you think need it the most. You also may benefit from guiding the way that feedback is received so that a) other people feel like it is okay to contribute, and b) your corresponding author’s email doesn’t get filled with non constructive, not actionable and unclear advice. 

Let's say, for example, that you and your team are drafting a research manuscript and are getting pretty close to having all the information in place for it to be shared as a preprint. This does not necessarily mean that it is in a stage that you would consider “final”—if such a stage even exists!—but it contains enough information so that others who are in the same or similar fields of research can understand what the work is about and correctly interpret your results. This may be a good time to solicit feedback from colleagues or the broader community, and maybe even guide it towards aspects of your work that you think would most benefit from review or contribution. 

Maybe you want to drive the attention of your contributors to the Methods section where a statistical analysis that is uncommonly used for the kind of experiment you conducted is described. Or maybe you would like some feedback from people with data visualization expertise so that you can best present your data.

Where should you put your contributor guidelines? You may have one place on your website where you can write general contributor guidelines to any open result you and your team share and link to the guidelines in your open result themselves. The contributor guidelines document can be part of the authorship and contributorship document you prepared following the tips in the previous section. You may even want to publish a version of record that has a permanent identifier so that the links would never “break”. Repositories such as Zenodo would allow you to post versions of the original documents that would be linked to one another.

General contributor guidelines that also include the authorship guidelines we talked about in the previous section may look something like this:

**_SAMPLE - XYZ Lab Authorship and Contributor Guidelines_**

**_How we determine authorship and acknowledge project contributors_**

_The specific contributions of all author and non-author contributors are always outlined in our open results._

_To determine authorship we follow the following guidelines:_

_[ADD YOUR AUTHORSHIP GUIDELINES]_

_Anyone who has contributed to the open results and is not an author is always acknowledged as a contributor in the acknowledgements section of the open results._

**_How to contribute to our open results_**

_Our team is committed to openly sharing our results with the research community. We welcome contributions to our work in the form of general feedback or specific suggestions on particular aspects of our work._

_Open results for which we are seeking feedback are linked and listed below:_



* _New research proposal - Link to pre-registered proposal_
* _Preprint - Link and/or DOI - particularly the methods section_
* _Protocols - Link to a protocols repository such as [protocols.io](https://protocols.io)_
* _Data - Link and/or DOI_
* _Source code - Link_

_We welcome feedback that is positive or negative as long as it is provided in a way that is constructive. We would love to hear suggestions on how you would address any issue you may identify with the work, with as much clarity and examples as you may be able to provide._

_Here are three ways you can provide us feedback:_



1. _You can send us an email at [XXX@XXX.XX](mailto:XXX@XXX.XX). In the body of your email please specify what result you are providing us feedback on, and be as specific as you can in referring to the part that you are talking about so that we are most likely to understand the feedback. We also welcome questions. We will ignore your email if the content is an attack to the work or our team. Without your explicit consent, we will not share the content of your email associated with your name outside of our team._
2. _You can publicly review our preprint by leaving a comment on the preprint server (if this option is available)_
3. _You can review our preprint on [PREreview.org](https://prereview.org), an open platform that enables anyone with an ORCID iD to review preprints—on PREreview you can post our review using your real name or the unique pseudonym that will be attributed to you at sign up._

_We thank you in advance for your time and willingness to help us improve our work._

**_What to expect after you contribute_**

_If your feedback came via email and is not an attack to our work or team, we will make sure to reply to you in a timely manner—please give our team up to 2 weeks to get back to you._

_If you wrote a review on PREreview or on the comment section of the preprint server, we would appreciate a quick email to [XXX@XXX.XX](mailto:XXX@XXX.XX) to let us know you did it. If the feedback is not an attack to our work or team, we will use the comment sections on PREreview or on the preprint server to reply, or, if you prefer, we can reply via email._

_If you give us consent either in the email or by posting your review under your real name, we will acknowledge you and your feedback in the next version of the open result._

_If your feedback results in a substantial intellectual contribution to the work, we will contact you to discuss opportunities for authorship in the next version of the open result._

How to set a successful open collaboration from the start 


## How to ensure your open results are properly attributed and cited by others 



* Associate your ORCID and that of your co-creators/authors with the results
* DOIs
* ORCID iD for authors 
* Ref to lesson 1?

Citation (and other forms of acknowledgment) have been the primary means by which researchers and scholars receive credit for their work. Put differently, citations have largely been the “currency” of science. In this section, we will discuss various ways that you can ensure that your work is citable and that when it is cited, that you are properly credited.

**DOI**

[https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable.html](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable.html) 


_“Online publications are attached to persistent identifiers that are used for citing them. It’s important to note that not everything published online gets a unique identifier but it is important that research objects are published online with DOIs as described below.”_


_“Unique identifiers or persistent links for digital objects are more formally called Digital Object Identifiers or DOIs. Using DOIs makes it much easier for others to cite your data, reduces the risk of link rot and means you can track how your research is being used and cited.”_

As discussed earlier (link to lesson 2?) almost every part of a research project is citable. A DOI provides one means for referencing and citing individuals research objects (e.g., data, figures/tables, manuscript, software packages). Including a doi with your work (whenever you share it online, when you place it on your CV, etc.) will help ensure that it is referenced (and indexed) appropriately. (We list resources for obtaining a DOI - if you do not receive one from the publisher, here: xxx)

**PID**

Similarly, researchers themselves can have unique identifiers. One, freely available service is ORCID.


_“ORCID is an acronym for ‘Open Researcher and Contributor ID’. ORCID is a long-lasting unique identifier for you as a researcher, comparable to a personal identification number that your government may issue to you.”_

Many journals and publishers are recommending that you include an ORCID iD alongside your submission (including peer review). This will link your manuscript (or peer review) to a PID.

There are other proprietary options, such as ResearcherID and Scopus Author ID. 

Whatever PID(s) you choose will have different strengths and limitations - whether in terms of cost, accessibility, reach, etc. And the type of PID that is chosen can vary across disciplines. See generally? [https://zenodo.org/record/4242882#.Yr3tonbMKUk](https://zenodo.org/record/4242882#.Yr3tonbMKUk)



* Provide a recommended citation with the result


## Assessment #1: Case study



* Identify the contributors to each research object, at each stage in the research process. 
* Were these contributors credited? If so, was their contribution credited fairly with best practices from open science? If not, what could have been done differently? 
* Identify contributors that could have added value to different stages of your project


## Self-assessment #2: Develop a contributor guideline for a future project you are considering
